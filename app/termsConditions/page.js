                    <p>Individual users wishing to participate in such Quizzes ("Participants") are invited to create their own profile on the Brainbucks Platform. Brainbucks offers its platform to Participants for Quiz(s) being created relating to each Quiz Contest, and Participants can participate in such Quiz(s) by paying a Platform Fee (if Applicable).</p>

                    <p><strong>Rules for selecting a winner of the quiz and distributing the prize pool:</strong></p>
                    <p>Total of top 20% participants are considered as the Winning group of a quiz, who receive the cash prize at the end of the quiz. Formula for calculating the Winners is:</p>
                    <p>r = (20 * TP) / 100</p>
                    <p>r = Number of Winners</p>
                    <p>TP = Total number of participants participating in the quiz.</p>

                    <p>The winners are determined by the accuracy of the answers they give to the questions asked in the quiz. Accuracy is determined by the following formula:</p>
                    <p>A = (Nc / Nq) * 100</p>
                    <p>Where,</p>
                    <p>A = Accuracy</p>
                    <p>Nc = Total number of questions answered correctly</p>
                    <p>Nq = Total number of questions asked</p>

                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If the total number of players participating in a quiz is 100, and the entry fee for each participant is 10 BB Coins, then the total prize pool is 800 BB Coins. This prize pool will be distributed among the top 20% players (i.e., 20 players).</p>

                    <p><strong>Distribution of the prize among winners:</strong></p>
                    <p>The achiever with the highest amount of accuracy gets the biggest chunk of the prize pool.</p>

                    <p>The distribution of the prize pool is determined by the following formula:</p>
                    <p>pp = (r - R) + r * PP / Tp</p>
                    <p>Where,</p>
                    <p>pp = Prize to be received by winner</p>
                    <p>R = Rank of Winner</p>
                    <p>r = Total number of winners</p>
                    <p>PP = Total amount of prize pool</p>
                    <p>Tp = Total Participants of the quiz</p>

                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If in the previous scenario, the total number of Winners (r) is 20 and the amount of prize pool (PP) is 800 BB Coins and the Total Participants (Tp) are 100, then according to the above formula, the winner with rank 1 will get a Prize (pp) of 312 BB Coins, and the winner with rank 2 will get 304 BB Coins, and so on.</p>

                    <p><strong>In case of a tie:</strong></p>
                    <p>If the accuracy of 2 players is the same, the player completing the quiz with a lower Average Time Per Question (T) is selected for a higher rank. The formula for calculating T is:</p>
                    <p>T = t / q</p>
                    <p>Where,</p>
                    <p>T = Average Time per Question</p>
                    <p>t = Total time taken to complete the quiz in seconds</p>
                    <p>q = Total number of questions asked in the quiz</p>

                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If two participants, A and B, have the same accuracy in a 10-question quiz, but A takes 20 seconds (T = 2) and B takes 25 seconds (T = 2.5), Participant A will be ranked higher.</p>

                        <p><strong>Selection of Winners</strong><br />
                        Total of top 20% participants are considered as Winning group of a quiz, who receives the cash prize at the end of the quiz. Formula for calculating the Winners is:<br />
                        r = ( 20 * TP)/100<br />
                        r = Number of Winners<br />
                        TP = Total number of participants participating in the quiz.<br />
                        The winners are determined by the accuracy of the answers they give to the questions asked in the quiz, accuracy is determined by the following formula:<br />
                        A = (( Nc )/ Nq)*100<br />
                        Where,<br />
                        A = Accuracy<br />
                        Nc = Total number of questions answered correctly<br />
                        Nq = Total number of questions asked.<br />
                        Example: If 100 players participate and entry fee is 10 BB Coins, the prize pool = 800 BB Coins (after deductions). It will be distributed among the top 20% (i.e. top 20 players).</p>

                        <p><strong>Distribution of the prize among winners:</strong><br />
                        The achiever with the highest accuracy gets the largest share. The prize pool is distributed using:<br />
                        pp = (r - R) + r*PP/Tp<br />
                        Where:<br />
                        pp = Prize of winner<br />
                        R = Rank of Winner<br />
                        r = Total winners<br />
                        PP = Total prize pool<br />
                        Tp = Total participants<br />
                        Example: If r = 20, PP = 800, Tp = 100 → Rank 1 gets 312 BB Coins, Rank 2 gets 304, and so on.</p>

                        <p><strong>In case of Tie:</strong><br />
                        If two players have same accuracy, the one with lower average time per question ranks higher.<br />
                        T = t/q<br />
                        T = Average time/question<br />
                        t = Total time taken (sec)<br />
                        q = Total number of questions<br />
                        Example: A completes in 20s → T=2s; B takes 25s → T=2.5s → A ranks higher.</p>

                        <p><strong>Contacting Winners</strong><br />
